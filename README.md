### Heatmap

## Usage

In order to use the script you will need to download your viewing activity data from https://www.netflix.com/viewingactivity. \
Then you need to create a Python file where you will import NDA.py. In this file you can use either the function bar_diagram
or heatmap giving the path of the data file and the output file.
